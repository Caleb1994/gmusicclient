# gmusicclient: a command line interface for streaming Google Play Music

gmusicclient provides a shell like interface into the Google Play Music API and provides the basic media player controls associated with the service.

The client is built using the [cmdln](https://github.com/trentm/cmdln) module in Python to build the shell like prompt. The commands are documented through [cmdln](https://github.com/trentm/cmdln)'s builtin help functionality.

Available commands and their usage may change at any time regardless of this README, but here is a snapshot of the help output of the client.
